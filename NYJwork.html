        <h2>Born A Crime</h2>
    <p>
        SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 1 AND CHAPTER 2<br>
    

        <br>
        
        1. RACISM<br>
        <br>
        
        Trevor Noah recalls his youth in the first and second chapters of Born a Crime. He was born in South Africa in 1984, during a time when black South Africans were divided by apartheid. Trevor describes his experiences during the end of apartheid. The many tribes had a long history of conflict, with the Zulus and Xhosa being the most dominant during apartheid. This is a serious issue of ethnic discrimination. Trevor was born to a black mother and a white father which was illegal and was punishable by imprisonment. 
        A similar issue of tribal and ethnic hate is evident in present-day Machakos County, where some tribal clans hate each other and cannot intermarry. <br>

        <br>
        
        2. CHRISTIANITY<br>
        <br>
        
        Trevor’s mother was so much into Christianity and she would take the whole family to multiple churches. These churches were the black church, the white church, and the mixed church. Trevor’s mother would never be intimidated by anything so easily since her faith in God was unwavering. This is evident in Machakos County where churches are found on every street corner, with each priest preaching about his Faith that will save all from the fires of hell. Each Sunday blares of speakers are heard from every corner keeping those around awake. Some people attend two different churches each Sunday to pray.
        There is so much similarity between the present world and back then.<br>
