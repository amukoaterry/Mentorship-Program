        <h2>Born A Crime</h2>
    <p>Trevor Noah wrote a book titled Born a Crime. He was born in a time when black South Africans were divided into tribes during colonialism, before apartheid divided the nation's people according to race. The two main groupings were the warrior Zulu people and the Xhosa people, who utilized tactics to repel the European invasion. This tactic resulted in prejudice and a lack of freedom, whereby one's ability to go around was restricted due to one's race.  Noah considers the complexity of race, identity, family, and religion that the marginalized communities in K.C. experience in today's society.
        Racial Identity Many people nowadays come from multicultural backgrounds, just as Trevor Noah struggled with his mixed-race identity. Immigration, globalization, and cross-cultural interactions have all contributed to the complexity of identity. Which has provided growth and ended discrimination based on your identity. It talks about race, ethnicity, and belonging, which are still prevalent. Diverse identities must still be accepted.
        Noah's mother placed a strong emphasis on empathy and education. These principles never go out of style. Education is more widely available than ever in the modern world, but empathy is frequently absent. Beyond social, ethnic, and cultural divides, we must foster compassion and understanding.
        Breaking preconceptions and accepting oneself: By being naughty and accepting of who he is, Noah disproved preconceptions. In today's society, it is imperative to vehemently reject stereotypes as well as promote self-acceptance and appreciation It is important to elevate voices that challenge norms because representation matters.
        Regarding religion, Patricia received varied teachings from various religions; this is evident in modern society since there are various Christian denominations, allowing individuals to select the one with which they identify most comfortably.
