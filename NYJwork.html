        <h2>Born A Crime</h2>
    <p>
        SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 1 AND CHAPTER 2<br>
    

        Born a Crime is a book by Trevor Noah that recounts his childhood experiences in South Africa during the apartheid era. The first two chapters of the book describe the end of apartheid, which saw tensions rise between different tribes, particularly the Zulus and Xhosas. This led to serious issues of ethnic discrimination, which is still prevalent in many parts of the world today, including Machakos County.

        Machakos County is an example of a place where certain tribal clans do not intermarry due to their hatred for each other. This is a similar issue to what Trevor faced as a child, where he was born to a black mother and a white father, which was illegal and punishable by imprisonment.<br><br> Trevor's mother was a devout Christian who took her family to various churches, including black, white, and mixed-race churches. This is similar to the situation in Machakos County, where churches are abundant, and priests preach to save people from the fires of hell. On Sundays, loudspeakers can be heard from every corner, keeping people awake. Some people attend multiple churches each Sunday to pray.<br><br>

        Trevor's mother's decision to ask a Swiss man to get her pregnant is another issue that is prevalent in many parts of the world, including my county. Many women have children despite disapproval from their parents or societal norms. These issues highlight how discrimination, tribalism, and societal norms can impact the lives of people. Trevor's mother's unwavering faith in God is a lesson to us all that regardless of the challenges we face, we should never lose faith in ourselves and our abilities to overcome these challenges.
